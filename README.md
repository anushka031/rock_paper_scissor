# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in Python

This is a simple implementation of the **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game using Python. The game allows a player to choose between rock, paper, or scissors, and then plays against the computer, which also makes a random choice. The game will display the winner based on the choices made.
